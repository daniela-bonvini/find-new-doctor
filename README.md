# FindNewDoctor

This project is a web application built with Angular that allows users to search for doctors based on various criteria. It provides a user-friendly interface to find healthcare professionals in different specialties.
As of right now (June 2025), the application is restricted to Marche region general doctors and uses a file `doctors.json` to simulate a backend API. In the future, it will be replaced with a real API endpoint if I can find one that provides the necessary data.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.
